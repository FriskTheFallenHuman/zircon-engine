// zircon_dpbeta_changes.txt - October 14 2023, November 12 2023

Zircon is DarkPlaces with a mouse-driven menu, ALT-ENTER fullscreen/windowed switch,
cut/copy/paste in console and enhancements mostly focusing on user-interface.

// Zircon Beta Release 5 - November 16 2023

1. Added r_waterwarp (winquake underwater effect) / r_waterdeform (twist water) to effects menu.
2. edicts [field name] [value] will find entities with that field equal to the value.

	Example:  edicts classname player --> this will find anything with a classname containing player
	          edicts model grenade --> this will find anything with a model that contains "grenade"
	          edicts mod gren --> this will check any field with "mod" in the name and return
	                               results with "gren" in the name.
	                               
    So yeah, it actually uses string partials for fieldname and value.
    
    edicts with 1 argument searches for classname.

3.  Eliminated 2 instances of console drawing for a single frame.
    First was on startup, the first frame seems to always draw the console (not any more!)
    Second was on new map (not any more!).

// Zircon Beta Release 4 - November 16 2023

1. Rewrote part of texture loader to more resemble DarkPlaces classic while keeping the intent
   of the changes in DarkPlaces Beta.
   
   This fixed texture scaling with "tcmod scale" with Quake_Rivarez_Ed_v1.0.1.
   And should fully fix "textures/[mapname]/[yourtexture].tga"
   
   And hopefully will fully address water and animated issues that previously existed.
   
   I don't conveniently have test cases for all of this, so not fully tested.
   
2. "infobar 5 your_message" sort of centerprints excepts as a subtitle.
   The timing of this was wrong, corrected (it was displaying half the appropriate time).
   
   NEW:  Since it is basically a different kind of centerprint, I have it log to console.
   
   To disable logging to console: "con_logcenterprint 0"
   
3. KleskBY likes "sv_gameplayfix_nogravityonground 1" because modern games don't have the player
   slide down slopes and such.  However it didn't "work".  Or rather how it works was documented.
   "sv_gameplayfix_nogravityonground 1" requires "sv_gameplayfix_downtracesupportsongroundflag 1"
   to function right with Quake.  Added to documentation of sv_gameplayfix_nogravityonground cvar.

4. TODO: Slight console flash during loading.


// Zircon Beta Release 3

1. 2020 XMas Jam map shades has .mdl using fence texture flag (16384).  The engine was processing
   the skin as transparent, but not rendering as transparent.  Fixed.
   
2. tool_marker "-36 25 244" -- will draw a topmost red marker where that location is. 

3. Theoretically fixed Replacement textures in "textures/yourmaps/cop3_4.tga" failing to work.
   This issue was inherited from DarkPlaces Beta.  A decent chance I have it fully resolved.

   CAVEAT: I don't have anything to really test this out.  I have a single texture test
   from Jakub1.  Map specific replacement textures that collide with another texture map
   are somewhat uncommon and I don't have one available for some more thorough testing.
   
   TODO: See if can improve upon solution for weird untested corner cases no one will likely
   ever encounter, but I have an awareness that the texture load process in DarkPlaces Beta is
   not directly equivalent to classic DarkPlaces.  This lack of equivalence may be involved in
   some weird tcmod scale issues I have seen that have no cause I have been able to locate yet.

// Zircon Beta Release 2

1. Use /MT as Visual Studio compiler option.  This embeds the .exe with some dependencies
   and reduces the need to download Visual Studio Run-times and such, which KleskBY
   says applies to Windows 7 and can apply in other cirumstances.

2. sv_gameplayfix_nudgeoutofsolid was defaulting 1, it is now correctly defaulting 0.
   We are using DarkPlaces classic physics in Zircon (DarkPlaces 2014 physics).  This
   artifact from new DarkPlaces physics wasn't removed.  Additionally: csqc 
   droptofloor mirrors old logic, this was on a TODO before and is now completed.

3174. "setpos" command.  Set origin and angles, for debugging. 

106b. "tool_inspector 1" -- entities are now sorted.

// Zircon Major Features

0000. Mouse driven menu
0001. ALT-ENTER support to switch from fullscreen to windowed mode.
0002. Key setup streamlined order, elimination of "???" for unbound keys.
0003. Thin console cursor, no cursor overwrite mode.
0004. Ctrl + Up, Ctrl + Down adjust size the console like JoeQuake.
0005. Crisp 2D autoscale based on 360 pixels of height (720 height is 2x magnification) with user customization possible.
0006. LodePNG used for PNG loading.
0007. Full auto-completion including SHIFT-TAB support and CTRL-SPACE autocomplete from nothing.
      Autcomplete is context sensitive and even autocompletes skybox names.
0008. Cut, copy, paste, select text and undo (CTRL-Z undo, SHIFT-CTRL-Z for redo) in the console.

	  (* does not support color codes or UTF-8 at this time and will disable selecting text automatically
	  while those characters are present.)

0009. Will attempt to use -data directory if id1 folder not found and no -game specified.

0061. DarkPlaces 2014 physics. Reverting to what I hope is traditional DarkPlaces 2014 engine physics which is what mods targeting DarkPlaces
      from 2014 for traditional DarkPlaces physics.  New DarkPlaces physics had immediate issue with Quake Combat+ on E1M1 (a soldier falls 
      through floor) and some Alkaline map printing droptofloor issues (one would naturally assume that
      in Quakespasm does not do this).  DarkPlaces 2014 physics do have issues with classic Quake occasionally, a great 
      example is E4M7 zombies above water after killing the zombies below water in the start of the map, but this does allow Zircon
      DarkPlaces Beta to correctly play mods made for DarkPlaces like Quake Combat+.
0070. "record" a demo at any time.  This feature is AFAIK not legitimately possible in DarkPlaces, some evil
      some evil occurs to make it happen.
0071. Maps menu (replaces Main->Help and Ordering) (pk3 containing menu replacements elements available in zip)
0072. Maps menu selected maps are added to console history for recall/reload with uparrow.
0073. Maps menu shows current map
0074. Maps menu is reentrant (selecting a map and then entering the menu will return you to the map menu
      with the most recently selected map still selected).
0081. Quake Remaster status bar option (sbar_quake 2) and original Quake status bar option (sbar_quake 1).
0082. r_waterwarp 2 twisty underwater effect.
0083. r_waterdeform 1 WinQuake-like water/slime deformation.  r_waterdeform 2, lava and teleporters too.
0084. BloodOmnicide DarkPlaces "roundwave" and "bulge" shader deformation support
0085. FitzQuake noclipping (sv_altnoclipmove 1 defaults on).
0086. OBJ maps are first class citizens for "maps" and maps menu (which replaces help/ordering).
      Kleskby makes maps in obj in Blender and DarkPlaces Beta supports them.
      You can also turn a model (like start.bsp) into obj with DarkPlaces "modeldecompile" command like
      "modeldecompile maps/start.bsp".  
      "modeldecompile" has autocomplete listing Q1 models.
0087. Fence texture model support for Q1 .mdl. (xmas jam 2020 shades map trees was test case)
0088. Status bar some portions reworked, particularly with +showscores held.
0089. Intel Graphics cards that report "No errors." on shader compile no longer spam console as if shader compile error occurred.
0090. "freezeall" command to stop "time" except for the player.  This toggles a cvar with a long name that already exists.
      And we reset sv_freezenonclients on new map (SV_SpawnServer) so it doesn't do strange stuff and removed the CF_NOTIFY so
      using this isn't spamming the console.
0091. Effects level in menu that allows easy setting of effects level (modelled after Xonotic's effects levels)
0092. "con_closeontoggleconsole 4" -- exact Quake behavior of tilde key where it NEVER emits to console under any circumstance.
      If you are used to Quake behavior it is highly annoying if the console is forced and you press tilde from habit
      but the console cannot be closed and get a surprise "backquote" character typed in the console.
      (Why do we call this the tilde key, but backquote is the unshifted?)
      
	  If you enjoy typing backquotes in the console, try con_closeontoggleconsole 0 to 3.
	  
	  "con_closeontoggleconsole 0" is the DarkPlaces default.
	  
0093. r_editlights_select_index, for use by r_editlights.  Allows selecting a specific light by the light #.
      Can make the creation and editing of rtlights files more convenient. r_editlights_edit parameters
      auto-complete as well.
      
0100. MAJOR MAP LOAD SPEEDUP FOR LARGE MAPS.  Mod_BSP_MakePortals only performed for Q1 and Q3 maps without vis data or when "r_novis 1".  Faster map load times by
      not generating data that will not be used for a map with vis data, which is most maps.
      This significantly reduces load times for large maps.  Set "mod_bsp_portalize 2" to force.
0101. csqc_enable cvar, defaults 1.  Ability to turn off csqc.  Requires map restart.
	  Any Quake single player mod that can run on vanilla Quakespasm, this is likely fine.
	  Other situations, it may work or may totally break the mod (Quake Combat+, for instance).
0102. Sound specification retry with lower specs on sound initialization failure (adapted from snd_main.c in classic DarkPlaces).      
	  Quake_Rivarez_Ed_v1.0.1 tends to cause this scenario, asking for 8 sound channels.
0103. Server browser more legible, more conservative, easier to read
0104. All sv_allowdownloads (that seem helpful) default on [more testing needed].  
	  Hardcoded disallow of "registered Quake paks" has been removed, this checked pop.lmp
	  which might exist in any total conversion mod.
	  
	  (the open source X-Men Ravages of Apocalypse has a pop.lmp, for instance).
0105. Uses Classic DarkPlaces lightning gun bolt.
0106. tool_inspector - examine entities visually in-game
0107. Optional separation of csqc rendering and the rendering of 2D elements (console, menu, etc.)

	  This only occurs with	csqc_full_width_height 1.  vid_conwidth/vid_height are set as indicated for each phase.
	  
	  csqc can get the entire vid_width, vid_height and the menu can use a separate scaled canvas.

0108. Slow loading mods automatically get a progress bar.  Grace period 1.5 seconds.
      The effective result is that normal use of Quake never displays a progress bar.
      However, if for some reason loading is slow (huge textures, tons of models, some other reason)
      the 1.5 second mark is hit and the progress bar shows. 
      
      This is to avoid the feel of "nothing is happening" while largely never showing a progress bar
      by default.
      
// Single player compatibility with Quake

1001. Standard Quake file paths for loading/saving on Windows and Mac (-nohome, Linux we will do DarkPlaces way).
1002. Standard Quake behavior for Q1BSP maps with no light data -- all entities in map render fullbright.  DarkPlaces beta differs from Quake and old DarkPlaces (div0-stable)
1003. Standard Quake behavior for "map", "kill", etc. which close the console in Quake.  Full list: map, load <game>, restart, changelevel, connect, reconnect, kill.
1004. Standard Quake appearance of bronzed characters (not yellow).
1081. Standard Quake appearance of status bar as an option (status bar backtile option)
1082. Standard Quake appearance of status bar/scoreboard, displaying total secrets, total monsters even if zero 
1083. "edict" and "edicts" (also "csedict" and "csedicts") commands.  
      "edict" and "edicts" are commands in standard Quake.

// Single player compatibility with Quakespasm (FitzQuake 0.85) norms

1201. "r_skyfog"    fog that looks like FitzQuake/Quakespasm which is defaulting fog alpha to 0.5 (r_skyfog value) if fog is not specified in map fogkey
1202. "map"         command with no params says map name.  This is a behavior in Quakespasm and most modern Quake engines have this feature.
1203. "game"        console command, same behavior as gamedir.
1210. shot1sid shotgun shells texture fix, in most Quake engines since 2000 (look at shotgun shells on DM3 bridge)
1211. 64-bit lightmap fix from Quakespasm
1241. Max save games in save game menu to 20 mirroring other engines.
1242. "sky"			Same as loadsky, this is the expected command and QuakeC that was not tested against DarkPlaces
	  will almost certainly use "sky" to change the skybox in a Quake single player release.
1243. "writeconfig" alias for "saveconfig"
1244. FitzQuake explicit cheat commands and give armor (god, noclip, fly, notarget) 
		"god 1" // Turn on god mode
		"god 0" // Turn off god mode
1245. FitzQuake give armor "give a 200"
1246. FitzQuake "inc", "dec" commands "inc x 5" or "dec x"
1247. "external_lits" cvar to allow option of not loading of colored light data.

1301. Disconnect automatically when "game" / "gamedir" used if not disconnected.

// Single player convenience

1401. sv_cheats defaults 1.
1402. Reset menu cursors on gamedir change
1403. log_file_stripcolors defaults 1 for more readable console .log file.
1411. "saveconfig" takes an argument so "saveconfig mine" is possible.
1412. animated texture warning is now a developer print, this occurs quake start.bsp
      Texture +0slipbot is animated (leading +) but has only one frame
1413. Disabled Windows keys.
1414. Automatic unload of "fte csqc-lite" csprogs.dat allowing convenient play of these mods (see alk1.2.zip @ Quaddicted)
      This is an alternate CSQC that FTE/Quakespasm Spiked supports.
1421. FitzQuake centerprint logging ("This hallway selects EASY skill" prints to console, some maps have important centerprint messages)
1451. Less spam of clutter to console.
1461. Eliminated message for missing beam.mdl, this is a virtually non-existent model no other engine precaches or warns about.
      And any mod that actually uses it should precache it in QuakeC.  It is for TE_BEAM, a grappling hook effect.
1462. Progress bar maxfps to 10 from 20 mirroring DarkPlaces classic.  The less this is on-screen, the faster content loads.
1471. "maps" command only lists playable maps (info_player_start, info_player_deathmatch found).   This may not be compatible with
      Xonotic / Quake3 /  mods that do not use those entity types.  Additionally, a md3 content replacement healthbox with a .bsp
      extension is known to evade this filter and get printed (due to not falling into a BSP type).
1481. Reduced message "spam" for ALT-ENTER and other frequent situations
1482. ALT-ENTER with vid_desktopfullscreen (the default) uses 75% width/height for windowed mode automatically.
1483. vid_resizable defaults 1.
1484. -nehahra creates r_waterripple, r_oldsky, stopmod to prevent seeing missing cvar/command messages during play.
1485. Write history file on gamedir change during session.  DarkPlaces saves history file to current gamedir and
      this closes a "missing history" loophole.
1486. History lines are always trimmed of trailing spaces, back-to-back same lines are not recorded to history.
1487. Crosshair settings added to classic menu.
1488. "r_viewmodel_ring_alpha 0.4" available to make gun translucent during invisibility 
	  instead of entirely hiding it.  Works well with gl_polyblend 0 (which eliminates invisibility screen darkening effect).
1489. "r_viewmodel_offset 5" available to make gun offset to side.
1490. "r_minlight 3.5" option -- minimum lighting allowed on models, purpose is to make monsters/players
      more visible in poorly lit areas for more enjoyable play.  
      
      Unlike DarkPlaces, this defaults to 0.5 which means monsters in total darkness are slightly lit.
      
      To disable this, do "r_minlight 0"

// New commands / cvars

3101. "copy" copies console to clipboard, "copy ents" copies map entities to clipboard.
3102. "folder" command -- opens gamedir folder in file explorer.  "folder maps" would open the maps folder.
3103. "pwd" command - prints current directory ("pwd" is a Unix command that shows current directory) 
3171. "pos" command - prints current position, copies it to clipboard.
3172. "nostartdemos" cvar - set to 1 and they do not start.
3173. "cvar_reset"

// Performance

5001. Laptop friendly default cl_maxfps 144 (not 0 unlimited).  Laptops have 90% of personal computer marketshare.
      Laptops have a battery and laptops have small cooling fans.  Rendering at 800 fps for no particular reason is
      is not nice to a laptop battery and it is not nice to a laptop cooling fan.

5002. cl_prydoncursor_notrace defaults 1 (off).  This does not need to run every frame.  I know of no mod aside from Prydon Gate that uses it.

// Developer

7001. freetype.dll that is friendly with Visual Studio 2022 and does not cause exception with ntdll.dll
7002. Baker.h - tons of functions (file system, string, matrix, etc.)
7003. csqc_full_width_height 1 will set vid_conwidth/vid_conheight to entire client area (like vid.width/vid.height) during csqc phase and then change it back
7004. cvar if (cvar(csqc_full_width_height_available)) is a way for csqc to check for this.  Todo: check extension instead?
7061. "modeldecompile" commmand (writes a model as .obj) converts * (asterisk) to _ (underscore) for sub-models so that they
      can be written to file on Windows which will not allow asterisks in a filename.
7062. textures/particles/lightning -> particles/lightning .. this is a change but all particle gfx live in particles folder 
      and it is silly to have 1 file related to particles living in a weird place as the only member of its folder.
7063. r_listmaptextures [optional partial to find] like "r_listmaptextures water"
7081. showtex 1 displays only texture information, showtex 2 displays texture information and entity
7082. showpos and showangles cvars.
7083. showfps -1 shows fps in top right corner of screen where most other engines display frames per second
7084. prvm_sv_gamecommands, prvm_sv_progfields, prvm_cl_gamecommands, prvm_cl_progfields, prvm_menu_gamecommands
		These assist autocompletion with gamecommand extension.

		Strike prvm_menu_gamecommands, there is no CF_MENU and I'm not testing against menu qc
		at this time anyway ... future TODO
		
7101.  "edicts" with classname, targetname filter ability
			> edicts targetname t18  ... prints edicts with targetname containing "t18"
			> edicts info_player	 ... prints edicts with classname containing "info_player"
			 
7102.	"Failed to load sound" has been changed from a Con_Print (prints to console) to a DPrint
		(prints to console if "developer 1") for identical behavior to DarkPlaces classic.
		Mods may use a null.wav for a sound that they don't want or as a placeholder, and mods
		that did this had the expectation it wouldn't print to console. 			 

7103.	Autocomplete support "sv_cmd" and "cl_cmd" console commands (this is DarkPlaces 
		"gamecommand" extension).  The QuakeC can set prvm_cl_gamecommands or prvm_sv_gamecommands
		to a space delimited list like "sv_cmd volcano rain snow", the engine will offer 
		rain, snow, volcano as autocompletes for sv_cmd.

7104.	r_editlights_dlight_bake - combined with a QuakeC tool, this assists in relocating
        Quake 3 dynamic lights generation to a rtlights file in the expected location.
		
7105.	"jack_scripts" -- a tool to make a copy of Q3 shaders with things that J.A.C.K. map editor 
		doesn't understand.
        The J.A.C.K. map editor has "blocking" warning messages, so if there are hundreds of warnings
        saying it does not recognize shader command "dpoffset" or such, it can delay startup by a fraction
        of a second times 500, which can total a minute or 2 and is very annoying.
        The output is the "_jack_scripts" folder.
        It also updates scripts/shaderlist.txt
        		
// Zircon

8001. "zircon_command_line.txt" support.  If file exists in .exe folder it contains command line params like "-game travail +map start -condebug" and if engine is started with no command line parameters, these are used
8002. Zircon console name - including build name
8003. Zircon changes the progress bar color default from blue to gray.
8011. Removed progs/v_nail2.mdl from r_nolerp list to mirror Zircon
8012. Removed deathmatch mini-overlay
8013. r_nearest_2d and r_nearest_conchars default 1.  r_nearest_conchars cvar updates texture in real-time.
8081. Demo playback does not capture mouse cursor.
8082. scr_loadingscreen_barheight defaults 0 (previous value was 8), added it as a menu setting.
      (The loading bar reduces the immersion into the game for me.  It looks great for Quake 3 style.)
8083. showfps only displays a framerate if fully connected cls.signon == SIGNONS_4
8084. crosshair color defaults to gray (previously red)
8085. "scr_clock" ProQuake looking clock option 0/1, shows level time in status bar
8086. showfps never displays in red
8087. Cvars that DarkPlaces Beta prefixed with cl_ while maintaining aliases (showtex, etc.) have had their cl_ form removed to
      reduce cvar and that it seems unlikely there is someone who likes to type more to access a previously existing cvar especially if the alias exists.
      The namespace of cvars beginning with cl_ is already heavily populated.
8088. Removal of the new "timescale" alias, a cvar alias for host_timescale.
      There is no need for aliases for an uncommonly used cvar that already a standardized name.
      host_timescale is the name by used other Quake engines and the Valve source engine.
8089. sbar_scorerank and sbar_gametime game time removed.
8090. sbar_showprotocol (defaults 1) shows server protocol discretely if +showscores active and playing connected to a server.
8191. Server to client communication of single player skill level (nightmare, easy) in a way that is ignored by DarkPlaces or regular Quake clients.
8192. "cl_maxconsole_menu_fps" (defaults 72)  when not hosting a multiplayer game, frame rate is throttled when 
		in the console or menu.  DarkPlaces already throttles when not the active window, this closes a loophole
		where another situation where runaway frames per second can occur with no benefit to the user.
8193. cl_rate default increased to 9 999 999, reduce time waiting for models/maps to download.

// DarkPlaces Bug Fixes

9001. viewzoom CL default fix.  Avoids zoom effect on the start of every Quake map by reseting cl viewzoom field.
9002. DarkPlaces Beta gamedir switch crash bug-fix.  This has a few different pieces.  Rewrote hash unlinking code.
      In total, 3 or 4 separate areas were gamedir change affected cvars negatively were addressed.
      I believe that it is entirely fixed in full now, but I am going to keep an eye on this.

9003. Clear models/sounds as stale on gamedir change, they aren't valid any more -- avoid errors/issues with wrong content and stale data
9004. Fire Key release on ALT-TAB or minimize (if holding +forward and then ALT-TAB at same time, you will walk forward forever in current dpbeta on Windows)
9005. Quakespasm's Windows DPI awareness trick, fixes menu placement and other 2D elements when Windows scaling is not set to 100% but a higher value like 125% or 150%
9006. Kleskby ALT-TAB fix for certain international keyboards. (I'm not sure it belongs in CL_UpdateScreen though ... the important part is that it works ...)
9007. Maps of type .obj did not have loadmodel->lit set.  It is true that .obj does not have lighting, but should act as if it does
      so that DarkPlaces dynamic lighting or other methods can light the map.
9008. Q3 lightstyle support for world (Hemebond pointed this out on DarkPlaces Github), adapting what 
      classic DarkPlaces does to the DarkPlaces Beta rendering scheme.
9011. DarkPlaces Beta was only loading the first q1bsp sky.  Successive map changes, a q1bsp sky was always ignored so as a result E1M1 would have a purple start map sky instead of a blue sky.
9012. More ALT-TAB key release hardening and made in_releaseall clear kbutton structs.
9061. DarkPlaces Beta gamedir switch crash had 2 more factors.  Resolved.  Also rewrote the hash unlink code (although it does not zfree the hash, should it?  DarkPlaces Beta doesn't.)
9062. Clear models/sounds was partially ineffective due to new DarkPlaces Beta different order of events, fixed.
9063. (FIXED, BUT POSSIBLY NOT THE RIGHT FIX).  Quake Combat+ map E1M2 bridge, DarkPlaces Beta shows blue light and DarkPlaces classic does not.  The .rtlights file
      has negative rgb values for some colors (3.540270 -0.000000 -2.528764).  Zircon DarkPlaces Beta clamps the RGB values on
      read to a minimum of 0.  However, this cures only the effects of a yet identified difference, the root cause has not
      yet been identified.
9064. Fixed -> Real-time light editor display unaligned and the end of color data spanned beyond the box.
9065. cmd.c -> Baker r9065: a theoretical physics correction (probably.  I know of no way to mass test to prove or disprove)
        .. sv_gameplayfix_droptofloorstartsolid 1 for Quake instead of sv_gameplayfix_droptofloorstartsolid 0.  Testing various versions of DarkPlaces, this change was introduced
        in 2012 at some point, if I recall (I investigated this thoroughly at the time comparing source codes of DarkPlaces 
        of making this change in Zircon classic).  I used a map "cdestroy" which had always played ok in DarkPlaces which
        has rotweilers outside the first door.  At some point, these rotweilers no longer dropped to floor correctly.  I identified the
        first version where this occurred and the change that occurred.  I have so far seen no counter-indications and have
        seen incorrect behavior that this has resolved on multiple maps.
9066. gl_texturemode is reset on gamedir change.  Quake 1.5 causes a problem setting this to something else (nearest?) making
      the console conchars all jagged.  gl_texturemode is not a cvar, therefore it does reset on gamedir change, this is done manually in cmd.c.
      I would file this as a mild bug since gamedir change is supposed to reset everything.
9067.  (IMPLEMENTED BUT DISABLED, HOPEFULLY NOT NECESSARY) This bug seems to be a non-issue in DarkPlaces Beta for reasons I have not yet identified.
	   DarkPlaces supports the server precaching models and sounds after start of a map.  However, on loadgame 
       single player client, entities using these precached models only get the "standard QuakeC" precache list.

		(NON-ISSUE) ?  DarkPlaces Beta handles many things differently including network.  It is possible that
		DarkPlaces closed a loophole somewhere in the order of events, messages or in the precache process.
		This bug is hard to produce in DarkPlaces 2014 and I can't cause it in DarkPlaces Beta at all so far.
		(TODO: Examine DarkPlaces Beta and find out what changed.  My best guess: DarkPlaces fixed the issue
		client-side, which is the correct fix.)

9068u. FIXED. DarkPlaces Beta often gets keys stuck.  Key_Event in DarkPlaces Beta used Cbuf_InsertText
       instead of Cbuf_AddText ... reversing the order of queued key events resulting in key releases
       occuring before key presses, causing keys to be permanently stuck sometimes.

Unfixed or Unverified Bugs ...

9070u. Lightmaps don't render for the first frame or 2 (sometimes).  I suspect the first couple of frames
       that they haven't uploaded yet.

9072u. UNINVESTIGATED SO FAR: I saw Linux print segfault on shutdown.  Does it still happen?  


9073u. NOT FIXED YET, BUT MITIGATED.  Quake Combat+ map E1M2 start, the shader for *water1 contains tcMod scale 0.05 0.05 which according to 
       Q3 Shader reference should decrease the size of the texture, making it repeat.  Instead, of shrinking the texture, it
       enlarges it (the opposite).  There are other tcmods in the mix tcMod stretch sin 1 .001 .05 .2 and tcMod scroll 0.016 0.01
       and it is not clear why this occurs and although this is behavior difference between DarkPlaces Beta and DarkPlaces classic,
       it is not known if this is a bug or if DarkPlaces Beta is correctly applying the shader.

       The shader text is:

*water1
	surfaceparm water
	surfaceparm nomarks
	surfaceparm trans
	deformvertexes wave 10 sin 1 1 .1 .6

    Q3 Shader Reference

    tcMod scale <sScale> <tScale>
    Resizes (enlarges or shrinks) the texture coordinates bymultiplying them against the given factors of <sScale> and <tScale).
    The values "s" and "t"conform to the "x" and "y" values (respectively) as they are found in the original texture TGA. 
    The values for sScale and tScale are NOT normalized. This means that a value greater than 1.0 will increase the size of 
    thetexture. A positive value less than one will reduce the texture to a fraction of its size and 
    cause it to repeat within the same area as the original texture (Note: see clampTexCoords for ways to control this).;

9501. vid_ignore_taskbar defaults to 1.
      The centering that occurs with taking taskbar into consideration is not center of screen.
      The off-center "center of the screen" window felt weird.

9511. Fixed vid_sdl.h so Windows get a titlebar icon consistently.  Sometimes it was there, sometimes not.
