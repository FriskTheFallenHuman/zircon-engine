// Zircon Major Features

0001. ALT-ENTER support to switch from fullscreen to windowed mode.
0002. Key setup streamlined order, elimination of "???" for unbound keys.
0003. Thin console cursor, no cursor overwrite mode.
0004. Ctrl + Up, Ctrl + Down adjust size the console like JoeQuake.
0005. Crisp 2D autoscale based on 360 pixels of height (720 height is 2x magnification) with user customization possible.
0006. LodePNG used for PNG loading.

// Single player compatibility with Quake

1001. Standard Quake file paths for loading/saving on Windows and Mac (-nohome, Linux we will do DarkPlaces way).
1002. Standard Quake behavior for Q1BSP maps with no light data -- all entities in map render fullbright.  DarkPlaces beta differs from Quake and old DarkPlaces (div0-stable)
1003. Standard Quake behavior for "map", "kill", etc. which close the console in Quake.  Full list: map, load <game>, restart, changelevel, connect, reconnect, kill.
1004. Standard Quake appearance of bronzed characters (not yellow).

// Single player compatibility with Quakespasm (FitzQuake 0.85) norms

1201. "r_skyfog"    fog that looks like FitzQuake/Quakespasm which is defaulting fog alpha to 0.5 (r_skyfog value) if fog is not specified in map fogkey
1202. "map"         command with no params says map name.  This is a behavior in Quakespasm and most modern Quake engines have this feature.
1203. "game"        console command, same behavior as gamedir.

1301. Disconnect automatically when "game" / "gamedir" used if not disconnected.

// Single player convenience

1401. sv_cheats defaults 1.
1402. Reset menu cursors on gamedir change
1403. log_file_stripcolors defaults 1 for more readable console .log file.

// New commands

3101. "copy" copies console to clipboard, "copy ents" copies map entities to clipboard.
3102. "folder" command -- opens gamedir folder in file explorer
3103. "pwd" command - says current directory

// Performance

5001. Laptop friendly default cl_maxfps 144 (not 0 unlimited).  Laptops have 90% of personal computer marketshare.
      Laptops have a battery and laptops have small cooling fans.  Rendering at 800 fps for no particular reason is
      is not nice to a laptop battery and it is not nice to a laptop cooling fan.

5002. cl_prydoncursor_notrace defaults 1 (off).  This does not need to run every frame.  I know of no mod aside from Prydon Gate that uses it.

// Developer

7001. freetype.dll that is friendly with Visual Studio 2022 and does not cause exception with ntdll.dll
7002. Baker.h - tons of functions (file system, string, matrix, etc.)
7003. csqc_full_width_height 1 will set vid_conwidth/vid_conheight to entire client area (like vid.width/vid.height) during csqc phase and then change it back
7004. cvar if (cvar(csqc_full_width_height_available)) is a way for csqc to check for this.  Todo: check extension instead?  

// Zircon

8001. "zircon_command_line.txt" support.  If file exists in .exe folder it contains command line params like "-game travail +map start -condebug" and if engine is started with no command line parameters, these are used
8002. Zircon console name - including build name

// DarkPlaces Bug Fixes

9001. viewzoom CL default fix.  Avoids zoom effect on the start of every Quake map by reseting cl viewzoom field.
9002. DarkPlaces Beta gamedir switch crash bug-fix
9003. Clear models/sounds as stale on gamedir change, they aren't valid any more -- avoid errors/issues with wrong content and stale data
9004. Fire Key release on ALT-TAB or minimize (if holding +forward and then ALT-TAB at same time, you will walk forward forever in current dpbeta on Windows)
9005. Quakespasm's Windows DPI awareness trick, fixes menu placement and other 2D elements when Windows scaling is not set to 100% but a higher value like 125% or 150%

// Other

9501. vid_ignore_taskbar defaults to 1.
      The centering that occurs with taking taskbar into consideration is not center of screen.
      The off-center "center of the screen" window felt weird.
