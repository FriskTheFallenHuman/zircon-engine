Developer With Extra Detail - Work In Progress - November 5 2024

===================================================================================================

1. "pos" - print current position.  Related: "showpos 1; showangles 1"

	]pos
	pos to clipboard: 
	"origin" "  7 -1296  24"
	"angles" "  2 -91   0"

2. Map command shows how many triangles in the map (for optimization).

	]map
	map is around7

	wateralpha?    Yes
	vis data?      Yes
	num triangles  136 (verts: 274)
	normalmins/max (-2464.0 -2560.0 -256.0) (5632.0 2560.0 1056.0)
	size           8096.0 5120.0 1312.0

	Type "devinfo" for map worldspawn keys
	
   Note Quake 3 bsp format is triangle efficient and Quake 1 bsp format is triangle wasteful.
   Quake 1 chops up surfaces for the WinQuake software renderer, creating large numbers of triangles.
   Quake 3 map format uses few triangles for a brush and also removes unseened surfaces (common/caulk)
   from the triangle rendering output.
   

3. "devinfo" -> map shows worldspawn keys.  If the map used a good modern map compiler that writes 
   the compile command line to worldspawn, it will also show the compile command line.
   
   If you map, you may have a map you compiled 6 months ago and can't remember the compiler command
   line to light the map ... use "devinfo".

4. "edict" command expands certain fields as follows:
	]edict 12
	classname      monster_shambler
	enemy          entity 1
	flags          131616 (32 + 512 + 131072)
	model          progs/shambler.mdl
	modelindex     46
	movetype       4 (movetype_step)
	nextthink      4.81874228
	origin         '-141.548157 -1011.69043 24.03125'
	solid          3 (solid_slidebox)
   
   Note that "movetype" and "solid", the enumeration constant word is indicated.  For "colormod",
   a color key will display showing the color.
   
   For "flags" and "spawnflags", the flag numbers that compose the number are printed "544 (32 + 512)"

5. "texturefindpos floor" will find a location in the map using that texture.

	]texturefindpos floor
	First occurance of texture: textures/azirc0/floor_lite_slate at 1631 1535 -1 to 2145 2049 1
	Location copied to clipboard
	setpos and press CTRL-V paste can take you there
	
6. "copy tex" will copy the texturename to the clipboard (when "showtex 1" is active).

	]copy tex
	texturename "textures/trak5x_sh/floor_floor2f" copied to clipboard


4. Mass JPEG conversion to JPEG with alpha channel support - "jpegsplit".

   Example will convert all .tga and .png in the textures/ambientcg folder ...

	] jpegsplit textures/ambientcg go // without go it will run a test that writes no files.
	3 results (Writing .jpgs)

	0: alpha? N - textures/ambientcg/Bricks018.tga
	1: alpha? Y - textures/ambientcg/Fence996.tga
	2: alpha? N - textures/ambientcg/MetalWalkway012.tga
 
   Textures with alpha channel will write 2 files:
   textures/ambientcg/Fence996.jpg		// the texture
   textures/ambientcg/Fence996_alpha.jpg	// the alpha channel
   
   Note that jpeg _alpha textures are supported by not only Zircon/DarkPlaces but the q3map2.exe
   Quake 3 map compiler.

   Alpha textures: Remember Quake 3 map format, you need a shader for alpha masked textures like:
   
	textures/fence01
	{
	 surfaceparm alphashadow // lighting phase of Q3Map2 use alpha channel as mask for casting shadows
	 surfaceparm trans // pre-computed visibility should not be blocked by this surface
	 cull disable // default is cullback
	 {
	  map textures/fence01.tga
	  alphaFunc GT0 // GT0 or LT128 or GE128
	 }
	 {
	  map $lightmap
	  blendfunc filter // shorthand for "blend gl_zero gl_src_color"
	 }
	}
