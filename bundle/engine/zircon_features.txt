Zircon Features Added

Partial List - November 5 2024. Updated November 7 2024.
===================================================================================================

- Mouse-driven menu.
- ALT-ENTER window fullscreen switch, resizable window.
- Quake Re-Release Support

- "devinfo" console command displays developer info in a mouse-driven interface.
- "tool_inspector 1" to visually examine entities.

- Maps menu (replaces Help/Ordering).
- Automatic 2D scaling to nearest 360P height.

- Save games menu with screenshots ("sv_save_screenshots 0" to disable).
- Save games have screenshots embedded in them (Quakespasm / DarkPlaces compatible = they ignore).
- Save games store background music playback progress (Quakespasm / DarkPlaces compatible = they ignore).

- Multiplayer Menu - server list sortable by map/player count shows who is playing.
- Windows is able to do WinQuake style dedicated server:  i.e. "c:\quake\zircon.exe -dedicated 8 +coop 1 +map start"
- WinQuake style dedicated server console can be pasted into.

- DarkPlaces effects levels in Menu->Options (effects tiers that group many settings).

- "eq" equation processor.  i.e. type "eq 2 + 2 + sin(1) + sqrt(4)" or "eq 0xFF" (hex) in the console.

- Multiple monster "brightening" options available in Menu->Options
- Windows sound start will fallback, reduce and retry if setup not available (instead of no sound).

- Supports mirror textures, .md3 and .obj models, the Quake 3 map format and .OBJ as a map format.
  (See KleskBY Qualker 0.2 for examples of Blender made OBJ models as a map.  Qualker 0.3 uses Q3 bsp.)

Console
===================================================================================================

The Zircon console supports selecting text, copying, pasting, select all (CTRL-A), undo (CTRL-Z)
and autocompletion from nothing (CTRL-SPACE).

Zircon has console autocompletion of over 50 types of fields.  It will complete your map name, your
model name, QuakeC entity fields, texture names, sounds names, demo names and many other types.

- "copy" command to copy console.
- "folder" command opens specified folder (no arguments opens current -game folder like "id1"). 
- Thin console cursor, no cursor overwrite mode.
- Size the console: Ctrl-Up, Ctrl-Down adjust size the console size like JoeQuake.
- Zoom: CTRL-PLUS zoom in, CTRL-MINUS zoom out, CTRL-ZERO reset zoom.
- Mouse-select rows and press CTRL-C to copy to clipboard.

- CTRL-SHIFT-Z is redo.
- CTRL-L clears console.

The following may disable selecting text at this time:

* Activating unicode ("utf8_enable 1")
* Use of a variable width console font like Arial.
* Colored text (^^3 ^3 I AM BRONZE^7) or (^^x888 ^x888 I am Gray^7)

Single Player Improvements
===================================================================================================

- Loads and renders fog like Quakespasm (DarkPlaces totally obscured sky with any fog).
- WinQuake underwater (r_waterwarp 2).
- WinQuake twisty water texture (r_waterdeform 1: water/slime, r_waterdeform 2: lava/teleporters too).
- Quake Remaster HUD (Quake 64 style HUD).
- FitzQuake/Quakespasm noclipping behavior + do not touch triggers (sv_altnoclipmove 0 to disable).
- Fence texture model support for Q1 .mdl (xmas jam 2020 shades map trees was test case).
- Several commands similar to Quakespasm for familiarity: "game", "setpos", "freezeall", "edicts" ..
- Key setup streamlined order, elimination of "???" for unbound keys.
- "sv_gameplayfix_fiendjumpfix 1" (default is 0, due to issues with Quake 1.5 sliding corpses).
- "snd_waterfx 1" -- muffles sound underwater (default is 1).
- gl_texturemode in menu and saves to config (Menu->Options->Video Mode).
- Fix for save game issues with saving special characters from ITdevkc ("wickedstart").
- Capable of playing Quakespasm protocol 666/999 demos (and as connecting as client or server).
- "shot1sid" shotgun shells texture fix almost all non-DarkPlaces engines have (see DM3 bridge shotgun shells).

- Handles quake.rc without default.cfg present in the file (SMEJ2)
- "record" a demo at any time
- Quake bronze color replaces DarkPlaces bright yellow for "bronzed text".
- "cl_beams_polygons 0" classic lightning is the default lightning gun effect.
- "mod_q3shader_default_polygonoffset -48" default for better Q3 decal projection. (Was -2 = flickers).

- +zoom is available.  "bind mouse2 +zoom".

DarkPlaces Protocol 7 Enhancements
===================================================================================================

Zircon extends DarkPlaces protocol 7 retaining full compatibility, a DarkPlaces 
client can connect to a Zircon server for example.

Zircon Protocol Extensions:

- FTEQW Chunked downloads (ZIRCON_EXT_CHUNKED_2)
  40-200 times faster than DarkPlaces normal download.
  
- Support for alpha, colormod, fullbright, noshadow, scale, additive for static 
  entities. (ZIRCON_EXT_STATIC_ENT_ALPHA_COLORMOD_SCALE_32)
  
- Zircon also sends more data on entity solidity, bounding box -- this allows
  better client-side prediction (ZIRCON_EXT_NONSOLID_FLAG_8, 
  ZIRCON_EXT_32BIT_RENDER_FLAGS_16, ZIRCON_EXT_SERVER_SENDS_BBOX_TO_CLIENT_64).
  
- Zircon also has experimental "1000 ping server mode" and players can walk
  through players capability to support full-client side movement cooperative
  game play with truly terrible ping. "Zircon Free Move".

Quakeworld
===================================================================================================

Zircon took DarkPlaces support for playing Quakeworld and improved it greatly:

1. Support for some FTE extensions for better cooperative play (Freewill's Let's QW Coop is great).
   PEXT_256PACKETENTITIES PEXT_ENTITYDBL PEXT_ENTITYDBL2
        
2. Support for FTE chunked downloads (super-fast, 40 to 200 times faster).  
   Chunked downloads are faster because the server does not wait for a reply
   before sending more data.
   
3. "join" and "observe" support.

4. Better spectator support.  (TODO: Detail of what was improved.)

5. "force_centerview" resets rollangle.

Quake 3 Map Packaging Command: "pak_this_map"
===================================================================================================

Load a Quake 3 format map and type "pak_this_map myfolder" now search through the bsp and find
textures, shader snippets and any .ogg or .wav files that the map has in entity fields and will put 
those in the folder -- ready to make a .pk3

TODO: Document "pak_this_map" aggregation mode.

Developer Quick List
===================================================================================================

1. "cvar_reset fov" resets fov to default.
2. "tool_marker 200 200 200" will display a marker at that position on the map (no depth check).
3. "tool_inspector 1" will display entity numbers on-screen with classname and model name.

4. "pos" print current position.  
5. "copy ents" entities text to clipboard (sv_saveentfile except to clipboard).
6. "showpos 1; showangles 1" show current position and angles.
7. "showtex 1" show texture name.  "copy tex" texture name to clipboard. "shaderprint" shader text.
8. "r_drawentities 29" will only draw entity 29.  On the start map, this is a wall zombie by lava.

9. Autocvars that are vectors will print a color key if values are in the correct ranges.

    ]particle_color1
    particle_color4 is "128 0 128" (^x808COLOR^7) ["128 0 128"] custom cvar

10. "edict" enhanced display (sorted, extra detail, flags bits, color key):

        ]edict 12
        classname      monster_shambler
        colormod       '6.03999996 1 1' (^xF33COLOR^7) // * color key
        enemy          entity 1
        flags          131616 ^3(32 + 512 + 131072)^7 // * flag combination
        model          progs/shambler.mdl
        modelindex     46
        movetype       4 ^3(movetype_step)^7 // * movetype constant displayed
        nextthink      4.81874228
        origin         '-141.548157 -1011.69043 24.03125'
        solid          3 ^3(solid_slidebox)^7 // * solid constant displayed

11. "edicts door" finds all entities with "classname" containing "door".
12. "edicts targetname door1" finds all entities with targetname containing "door1".

13.  "v_viewheight 28" for Half-Life. Quake is "v_viewheight 22". Crouching: "v_viewheight -20".
    
    For testing only as this is totally *not* at all the "right" way to do this.
    
    QuakeC: client.qc -> PutClientInServer -> self.view_ofs = '0 0 22'; // Right way to do this.

14. "map" shows how many triangles ==> num triangles  136 (verts: 274)

15. "texturefindpos floor" finds location in the map with "floor" in name (replacement textures).
16. "r_replacemaptexture city4_6 textures/apple.png" replace start map floor texture with apple.png.

17. "playvideo babel.gif" will play the animated gif "quake\id1\video\babel.gif" as a video.
18. Animated GIF to shader: "giftoshader myfile.gif" makes .tga files from quake/id1/myfile.gif, 
    shader text to clipboard.
===================================================================================================

19. "devinfo" -> "Models" shows triangle counts for every model.
20. "purgeall" clears all maps/models so they must completely reload (does not purge textures).
21. "showmodel progs/zombie.mdl" make func_illusionary model 200 units forward of player (model testing).

22. "modeldecompile" in Zircon supports submodels (func_door, func_wall .. they have names like "*38").
    "modeldecompile *38" will take start map func_bossgate floor of atrium and write a .obj model.    

23. "devinfo" -> "Map" shows all worldspawn keys ...

        "classname" "worldspawn"
        "_q3map2_version" "2.5.17ry_baker_2024_July_6"
        "_q3map2_cmdline" "-bsp -meta -mv 1000000 -mi 6000000 -samplesize 8; -vis -saveprt -fast; -light -deluxe -faster -cheapgrid -filter -gamma 0.5"
        "_generator" "J.A.C.K. 1.1.3773 Freeware (vpQuake3)"
        "_minlight" "24"
        "sky" "moonrise_"
        "fog" "0.04 0.3 0.2 0.3" // [density] [red] [green] [blue] [optional alpha few maps use causing Quakespasm to default r_skyfog 0.5]
        "sounds" "5" // This sound track ... sound/cdtracks/track005.ogg
        "message" "Welcome To This Map"        

24. "shaderprint" (with "showtex 1" on), prints shader text of texture looked at.

        ]shaderprint
        textures/savdm6ish/#teleport 
        { 
         qer_editorimage textures/zz_liquids/ruiner_teleport.jpg 
         qer_nocarve 
         surfaceparm noimpact 
         surfaceparm nolightmap 
         q3map_surfacelight 1000 
         cull disable 
         { 
          map textures/zz_liquids/ruiner_teleport.jpg 
          tcMod turb 0 0.2 0 0.04 
         } 
        }

===================================================================================================
25. Mass JPEG convert: "jpegsplit textures/ambientcg go" TGA/PNG + alpha channel as tex01_alpha.jpg.

    This was used to help turn the 5.4 GB Quake Rivarez Edition into a JPEG Version of 1.2 GB with 
    no loss of detail that I could notice, in part because the textures in Rivarez Edition are huge.
    
    Note that Quake 3 map format use of alpha channels in textures requires a shader.
    
        textures/fence01
        {
         surfaceparm alphashadow // light phase of Q3Map2 use alpha channel mask for casting shadows
         surfaceparm trans // pre-computed visibility should not be blocked by this surface
         cull disable // default is cullback
         {
          map textures/fence01.tga
          alphaFunc GT0 // GT0 or LT128 or GE128
         }
         {
          map $lightmap
          blendfunc filter // shorthand for "blend gl_zero gl_src_color"
         }
        }


26. MD3 Tags for Quake 1 .mdl:

    progs/shambler.mdl.md3tags contents ...

    // progs/shambler.mdl.md3tags
    // mdl tag file indicating triangles to tag (supports // comments)
    tagfacecenter,96,tagfacetop,121,tagfront1,95
  
    Example QuakeC that would put sunglasses on the Shambler:
    
        entity xt = spawn();
        xt.movetype = MOVETYPE_NOCLIP;
        xt.solid = SOLID_NOT_0;                 
        xt.classname = "attachment";            
        setattachment (xt, self, "tagfacecenter");
        xt.origin = '5 0 -3';
        xt.angles = '0 180 190';
        xt.scale = 0.4;
        xt.model = xt.mdl = "models/rayban.obj";
        precache_model  (xt.mdl);
        setmodel (xt, xt.mdl);           

27. MD3 Tags for OBJ Model:

    Here are how the MD3 Tags are defined in a OBJ (which is a text file model format):

        # File: models/vehicle/helicopter.obj
        mtllib unused.mtl
        #
        tagname propellor_topp -50.2 0.0 26.8
        tagname propellor_rear 102.8 0.7 20.6

Zircon Specific
===================================================================================================

1. Intermap Travel.  Return to a map and the entities from last exit persist.  Single player (ish).

   Example: Zircon Intermap Travel Demo

2. Shader: deformVertexes roundwave <radius> <wavesize> <radiusexponent> <x> <y> <z> {wavefunc}

   Source Blood Omnicide DarkPlaces.  Example map: park.bsp in Zircon Intermap Travel Demo.
   
   Example:
   
        textures/liquids/water4_wave
        { 
         qer_editorimage textures/zz_liquids/waterfall_alpha_72 
         surfaceparm water 
         surfaceparm noimpact 
         surfaceparm nolightmap 
         surfaceparm trans 
         cull disable 
        //<radius> <wavesize> <radiusexponent> <x> <y> <z> {wavefunc} 
         deformVertexes roundwave 200 200 0.5 -1660 666 3 sin 0 12.00  0.0 0.5 
         

         tessSize 64 
         q3map_globaltexture   
         dpGlossIntensityMod 0.75 
         dpGlossExponentMod 2.0 
         dpReflectCube cubemaps/dev_cubemap_ 
         q3map_bounceScale 1.50   
         {   
          map textures/zz_liquids/waterfall_alpha_72  
          rgbGen vertex 
          tcMod turb 0 0.2 0 0.08    
         } 
        }   

3. Shader deformation: deformVertexes bulge <bulgeWidth> <bulgeHeight> <bulgeSpeed>
   deformVertexes bulge 10 3 3 0.18 

4. Shader Framemap.  Allows buttons to change texture based on .frame.

        textures/trak5x_sh/buttonoid
        {
         qer_editorimage textures/trak5x/misc_button1.tga
         surfaceparm nolightmap
         {
          framemap textures/trak5x/misc_button1.tga textures/trak5x/misc_button2.tga
         }
        }

===================================================================================================

5. Zircon static entities support: alpha scale colormod EF_ADDITIVE EF_FULLBRIGHT EF_NOSHADOW

6. Zircon CSQC traceline constant MOVE_NETWORK_ENTITIES_BAKER_4096:

   Traceline to collides with (solid) network entities in CSQC like a Shambler.
   
   Zircon protocol extensions send bounding box mins, maxs and a "non-solid" flag for 
   func_illusionary type entities that render but are not solid.

7. Zircon CSQC getentity expansion (ZIRCON_GETENTITY_1 /*WIP*/):

   Examples: CSQC Monster Box Outliner, CSQC Quake With Health Bars, CSQC Monster Radar

   Mirroring FTEQW: 
   
   GE_MAXENTS_NEG1 (-1), GE_MODELINDEX_200, GE_EFFECTS_202, GE_FRAME_203, GE_ANGLES_204
   
   Zircon Added:
   
   GE_HEALTH_500, GE_MAX_HEALTH_501, GE_MONSTERTYPEHACK_503, GE_RENDERFLAGS_504, 
   GE_MONSTERTYPEQW_505,  GE_ENTITYBOX2D_506, GE_MONSTERCHAINFIND_512, GE_MONSTERCHAIN_OPEN_513, 
   GE_MONSTERCHAIN_GET_514, GE_PP_SECRETCHAIN_OPEN_520, GE_PP_SECRETCHAIN_GET_521
   
8. QuakeC "soundlength" bug-fix.  Zircon provides accurate sound length in seconds (bug fix).

9. MD3 Tags for .mdl (based on triangle number) and MD3 Tags for .obj

===================================================================================================

10. "csqc_polygons_darkplaces_classic_3d 1" cvar.  Causes Zircon to use DarkPlaces 2014 CSQC 
    R_BeginPolygon system instead of the more flexible DarkPlaces Beta CSQC R_BeginPolygon system.  
    
    The new polygon system can't do CSQC Pac-Man arcade machine + other of my CSQC experiments.
    
11. Zircon has CSQC texture precache fixes which may or may not be relevant, but I recall coding 
    them as sometimes vid_restart would crash out with issues about textures used in 3D drawing.  
    
    TODO: This note is "unreliable", but I cannot recall the details if resolution required shutdown 
    changes or some other nature resolved the issue or if precache of textures resolved.  
    
    TODO: See if we can recall how issue was conclusively resolved.

    The bottom line: Zircon does not have issue with reload/vid_restart of 3D only textures and 
    DarkPlaces 2014 definitely did.
  
12. Keyboard Setup (menu_keylist.txt to customize Menu -> Options -> Keyboard Setup) without using MenuQC

	Example: Create a file c:\quake\id1\menu_keylist.txt
	
	Contents of file:
	
	// menu_keylist.txt
	// bind			description
	"+attack" 		"attack"
	"+jump" 		"jump"
	"+zoom" 		"zoom"
	"" 			""
	"flashlight" 		"flashlight"
	"placeexplosive" 	"place explosive"
	"" 			""
	"nextweapon" 		"next weapon"
	"prevweapon" 		"previous weapon"
	"" 			""
	"+forward" 		"move forward"
	"+back" 		"move back"
	"+moveleft" 		"move left"
	"+moveright" 		"move right"
	"" 			""
	"+left" 		"turn left"
	"+right" 		"turn right"
	"+moveup"		"swim up"
	"+movedown"		"swim down"
	"+run" 			"run"
	"" 			""
	"messagemode" 		"talk"	
	
	The engine will use the above template for Menu -> Options -> Keyboard Setup
	
	Zircon Intermap Travel Demo is an example.
	
13. "csqc_full_width_height 1" allows a mod to access full screen resolution.

    Zircon indicates ability to offer full screen canvas to CSQC via checking the "csqc_full_width_height_available" cvar.
    
    If this cvar is 1 (Zircon engine), the CSQC can ask for a fullscreen canvas via cvar_set ("csqc_full_width_height",	"1");
    
    This will cause Zircon to separate CSQC 2D drawing to its own canvas that is independent from console and menu drawing.
    
    This gives CSQC the ability to have maximum high defintion of the entire screen for crisp, high resolution rendering in CSQC
    while getting the benefit of using engine scaled menu and console.

    CSQC example:
    
	if (cvar("csqc_full_width_height_available")) {
		cvar_set ("csqc_full_width_height", "1"	);
		ov.have_fullscreen = true;
	} else {
		ov.have_fullscreen = false;
	}
